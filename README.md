# github-graph

An experiment with scraping github data to n-triplets, running it in graph database (dgraph) and builing tech stack/simmilar-project recommendation engine.

## Motivation

- JS/TS Ecosystem is huge, moving fast, and there are counless cool things to find - but it takes a lot of effort to stay up to date and find relevant things
- It would be nice to find same-mindend folks, working on cool stuff and follow / collab with them on github - not just listen to twitter gurus
- Example is worth a thousand words, but sometimes short documentation hello-worlds simple does not cut it. There should be a convinient way to find open-source projects using specific tech stak

Also:

- I really like github's new Dependency Stack feature, but I want to use it deeper
- I want to battle-test Dgraph

## TODO

- I need some sort of micro-orm supporting external keys (xid) or it's gonna be spaghetti...
