## How I should be able to look?

- **By github stars/ forks**
  - I want to provide some github username and get results based on on currently starred projects
- **By project**
  - I want to point to a github repository and get results based on tech stack used there.
- **By (multiple) dependencies**
  - Without a hassle of actually having project. I want to provide list of libs/ tools and get recommendations based on this.
